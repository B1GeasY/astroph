1. [Resolving the Dust-to-Metals Ratio and CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor in the Nearby Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10561)

* I-Da Chiang et al.

We investigate the relationship between the dust-to-metals ratio (D/M) and the local interstellar medium environment at ~2 kpc resolution in five nearby galaxies: IC342, M31, M33, M101, and NGC628. A modified blackbody model with a broken power-law emissivity is used to model the dust emission from 100 to 500 um observed by Herschel. We utilize the metallicity gradient derived from auroral line measurements in HII regions whenever possible. Both archival and new CO rotational line and HI 21 cm maps are adopted to calculate gas surface density, including new wide field CO and HI maps for IC342 from IRAM and the VLA, respectively. We experiment with several prescriptions of CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and compare the resulting D/M-metallicity and D/M-density correlations, both of which are expected to be non-negative from depletion studies. The D/M is sensitive to the choice of the conversion factor. The conversion factor prescriptions based on metallicity only yield too much molecular gas in the center of IC342 to obtain the expected correlations. Among the prescriptions tested, the one that yields the expected correlations depends on both metallicity and surface density. The 1-œÉ range of the derived D/M spans 0.40-0.58. Compared to chemical evolution models, our measurements suggest that the dust growth time scale is much shorter than the dust destruction time scale. The measured D/M is consistent with D/M in galaxy-integrated studies derived from infrared dust emission. Meanwhile, the measured D/M is systematically higher than the D/M derived from absorption, which likely indicates a systematic offset between the two methods.

2. [Faint Quasars Live in the Same Number Density Environments as Lyman Break Galaxies at z ~ 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10194)

* Hisakazu Uchiyama et al.

Characterizing high-z quasar environments is key to understanding the co-evolution of quasars and the surrounding galaxies. To restrict their global picture, we statistically examine the g-dropout galaxy overdensity distribution around 570 faint quasar candidates at z ~ 4, based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program survey. We compare the overdensity significances of g-dropout galaxies around the quasars with those around g-dropout galaxies, and find no significant difference between their distributions. A total of 4 (22) out of the 570 faint quasars, 0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.4} (3.9_{-0.8}^{+0.8}) %, are found to be associated with the > 4 sigma overdense regions within an angular separation of 1.8 (3.0) arcmin, which is the typical size of protoclusters at this epoch. This is similar to the fraction of g-dropout galaxies associated with the > 4 sigma overdense regions. This result is consistent with our previous work that 1.3_{-0.9}^{+0.9} % and 2.0_{-1.1}^{+1.1} % of luminous quasars detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey exist in the > 4 sigma overdense regions within 1.8 and 3.0 arcmin separations, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that the galaxy number densities around quasars are independent of their luminosity, and most quasars do not preferentially appear in the richest protocluster regions at z ~ 4. The lack of an apparent positive correlation between the quasars and the protoclusters implies that: i) the gas-rich major merger rate is relatively low in the protocluster regions, ii) most high-z quasars may appear through secular processes, or iii) some dust-obscured quasars exist in the protocluster regions.

3. [The properties of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in galaxies: constraints on PAH sizes, charge and radiation fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10114)

* Dimitra Rigopoulou et al.

Based on theoretical spectra computed using Density Functional Theory we study the properties of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH). In particular using bin-average spectra of PAH molecules with varying number of carbons we investigate how the intensity of the mid-infrared emission bands, 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 microns, respond to changes in the number of carbons, charge of the molecule, and the hardness of the radiation field that impinges the molecule. We confirm that the 6.2/7.7 band ratio is a good predictor for the size of the PAH molecule (based on the number of carbons present). We also investigate the efficacy of the 11.3/3.3 ratio to trace the size of PAH molecules and note the dependence of this ratio on the hardness of the radiation field. While the ratio can potentially also be used to trace PAH molecular size, a better understanding of the impact of the underlying radiation field on the 3.3 microns feature and the effect of the extinction on the ratio should be evaluated. The newly developed diagnostics are compared to band ratios measured in a variety of galaxies observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that the band ratios can be used to probe the conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies and differentiate between environments encountered in normal star forming galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei. Our work highlights the immense potential that PAH observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will have on our understanding of the PAH emission itself and of the physical conditions in galaxies near and far.

4. [The evolution of the size-mass relation at z=1-3 derived from the complete Hubble Frontier Fields data set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10059)

* Lilan Yang et al.

We measure the size-mass relation and its evolution between redshifts 1<z<3, using galaxies lensed by six foreground Hubble Frontier Fields clusters. The power afforded by strong gravitation lensing allows us to observe galaxies with higher angular resolution beyond current facilities. We select a stellar mass limited sample and divide them into star-forming or quiescent classes based on their rest-frame UVJ colors from the ASTRODEEP catalogs. Source reconstruction is carried out with the recently-released lenstruction software. We derive the empirical relation between size and mass for the late-type galaxies with M‚àó>3√ó10<sup>9</sup>M‚äô at 1<z<2.5 and M‚àó>5√ó10<sup>9</sup>M‚äô at 2.5<z<3, and at a fixed stellar mass, we find galaxy sizes evolve as R<sub>eff</sub>‚àù(1+z)‚àí1.05¬±0.37. The intrinsic scatter is <0.1 dex at z<1.5 but increases to ‚àº0.3 dex at higher redshift. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in blank fields. We evaluate the uncertainties associated with the choice of lens model by comparing size measurements using five different and publicly available models, finding the choice of lens model leads to a 3.7 % uncertainty of the median value, and ‚àº25 % scatter for individual galaxies. Our work demonstrates the use of strong lensing magnification to boost resolution does not introduce significant uncertainties in this kind of work, and paves the way for wholesale applications of the sophisticated lens reconstruction technique to higher redshifts and larger samples.

5. [A Catalog of 220 Offset and Dual AGNs: Increased AGN Activation in Major Mergers and Separations under 4 kpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10051)

* Aaron Stemo et al.

During galaxy mergers, gas and dust is driven towards the centers of merging galaxies, triggering enhanced star formation and supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. Theory predicts that this heightened activity peaks at SMBH separations <20 kpc; if sufficient material accretes onto one or both of the SMBHs for them to become observable as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during this phase, they are known as offset and dual AGNs, respectively. To better study these systems, we have built the ACS-AGN Merger Catalog, a large catalog (N=220) of uniformly selected offset and dual AGN observed by HST at 0.2<z<2.5 with separations <20 kpc. Using this catalog, we answer many questions regarding SMBH -- galaxy coevolution during mergers. First, we confirm predictions that the AGN fraction peaks at SMBH pair separations <10 kpc; specifically, we find that the fraction increases significantly at pair separations of <4 kpc. Second, we find that AGNs in mergers are preferentially found in major mergers and that the fraction of AGNs found in mergers follows a logarithmic relation, decreasing as merger mass ratio increases. Third, we do not find that mergers (nor the major or minor merger subpopulations) trigger the most luminous AGNs. Finally, we find that nuclear column density, AGN luminosity, and host galaxy star formation rate have no dependence on SMBH pair separation or merger mass ratio in these systems, nor do the distributions of these values differ significantly from that of the overall AGN population.
