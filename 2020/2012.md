1.[Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback in an Elliptical Galaxy with the Most Updated AGN Physics: Parameter Explorations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15024)

* Zhiyuan Yao et al.

In a previous work, we have proposed a sub-grid model of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback by taking into account the state-of-the-art AGN physics, and used that model to study the effect of AGN feedback on the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy by performing two dimensional high-resolution (i.e., the Bondi radius is well resolved) simulations. In that work, typical values of model parameters were adopted. In the present work, we extend that study by exploring the effects of uncertainties of parameter values. Such a study is also useful for us to understand the respective roles of various components of the model. These parameters include the mass flux and velocity of AGN wind and radiative efficiency in both the hot and cold feedback modes, and the initial black hole (BH) mass. We find that the velocity of AGN wind in the hot mode is the most important quantity to control the typical accretion rate and luminosity of AGN, and the mass growth of the BH. The effect of the wind on star formation is less sensitive. Within the limited parameter range explored in the current work, a stronger AGN wind suppresses star formation within ~100 pc but enhances star formation beyond this radius, while the star formation integrated over the evolution time and the whole galaxy roughly remain unchanged. AGN radiation suppresses the BH accretion in a mild way, but dust is not considered here. Finally, a smaller initial BH mass results in a more violent evolution of the BH accretion rate. The corresponding AGN spends more time in the high-luminosity state and the percentage of BH mass growth is higher. Our results indicate the robustness of AGN feedback in keeping the galaxy quenched.

2. [A search for radio jets from massive young stellar objects. Association of radio jets with H2O and CH3OH masers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14729)

* U. Kavak et al.

Recent theoretical and observational studies debate the similarities between the formation process of high-mass (>8 Msun) and low-mass stars. The formation of low-mass star formation is directly associated with the presence of disks and jets. According to this scenario, radio jets are expected to be common in high-mass star-forming regions. We aim to increase the number of known radio jets in high-mass star forming regions by searching for radio jet candidates at radio continuum wavelengths. We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe 18 high-mass star-forming regions in the C band (6 cm, ~1.0 arcsec resolution) and K band (1.3 cm, ~0.3 arcsec resolution). We have searched for radio jet candidates by studying the association of radio continuum sources with shock activity signposts. We have identified 7 as the most probable radio jets. The radio luminosity of the radio jet candidates is correlated with the bolometric luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. About 7-36% of the radio jet candidates are associated with non-thermal emission. The radio jet candidates associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser emission are preferentially thermal winds and jets, while a considerable fraction of radio jet candidates associated with H2O masers show non-thermal emission, likely due to strong shocks. Our sample of 18 regions is divided in 8 less evolved, infrared-dark regions and 10 more evolved, infrared-bright regions. We have found that ~71% of the identified radio jet candidates are located in the more evolved regions. Similarly, 25% of the less evolved regions harbor one of the most probable radio jets, while up to 50% of the more evolved regions contain one of these radio jet candidates. This suggests that the detection of radio jets in high-mass star forming regions is larger in slightly more evolved regions.

3. [The Awakening Beast in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy KUG 1141+371 I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14254)

* Jiachen Jiang et al.

KUG 1141+371 is a Seyfert 1 galaxy that shows a simultaneous flux increase in the optical and UV bands in the past decade. For instance, the latest Swift observation in 2019 shows that the UVW2 flux of the AGN in KUG 1141+371 has increased by over one order of magnitude since 2009. Meanwhile, the soft X-ray flux of KUG 1141+371 also shows a steady increase by one order of magnitude since 2007. The significant multi-wavelength luminosity change is likely due to a boost of mass accretion rate from approximately 0.6% of the Eddington limit to 3.2%, assuming a black hole mass of 108M⊙. In this work, we conduct detailed multi-epoch X-ray spectral analysis focusing on the variability of the X-ray continuum emission and the puzzling soft excess emission. In addition, our SED models also suggest a simultaneous increase of disc temperature and a decreasing inner disc radius along with the increasing accretion rate. Finally, we discuss possible connection between KUG 1141+371 and black hole transients in outburst.

4. [On the TP-AGB contribution to the light of nearby disk galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13989)

* Eric E. Martínez-García et al

The study of the luminosity contribution from TP-AGB stars to the stellar populations of galaxies is crucial to determine their physical parameters (e.g., stellar mass and age). We use a sample of 84 nearby disk galaxies to explore diverse stellar population synthesis models with different luminosity contributions from TP-AGB stars. We fit the models to optical and NIR photometry, on a pixel by pixel basis. The statistics of the fits show a preference for a low luminosity contribution (i.e., high mass-to-light ratio in the NIR) from TP-AGB stars. Nevertheless, for 30-40 % of the pixels in our sample a high luminosity contribution (hence low mass-to-light ratio in the NIR) from TP-AGB stars is favored. According to our findings, the mean TP-AGB star luminosity contribution in nearby disk galaxies may vary with Hubble type. This may be a consequence of the variation of the TP-AGB mass-loss rate with metallicity, if metal-poor stars begin losing mass earlier than metal-rich stars, because of a pre-dust wind that precedes the dust-driven wind.

1. [Evolution of Galaxy Star Formation and Metallicity: Impact on Double Compact Objects Mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02800)

* Lumen Boco et al.

We study the impact of different galaxy statistics and empirical metallicity scaling relations on the merging rates and on the properties of compact objects binaries. First, we analyze the similarities and differences of using the star formation rate functions or the stellar mass functions as galaxy statistics for the computation of the cosmic star formation rate density. Then we investigate the effects of adopting the Fundamental Metallicity Relation or a classic Mass Metallicity Relation to assign metallicity to galaxies with given properties. We find that when the Fundamental Metallicity Relation is exploited, the bulk of the star formation occurs at relatively high metallicities even at high redshift; the opposite holds when the Mass Metallicity Relation is employed, since in this case the metallicity at which most of the star formation takes place strongly decreases with redshift. We discuss the various reasons and possible biases originating this discrepancy. Finally, we show the impact that these different astrophysical prescriptions have on the merging rates and on the properties of compact objects binaries; specifically, we present results for the redshift dependent merging rates and for the chirp mass and time delay distributions of the merging binaries.
