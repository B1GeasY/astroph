1.[Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback in an Elliptical Galaxy with the Most Updated AGN Physics: Parameter Explorations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15024)

* Zhiyuan Yao et al.

In a previous work, we have proposed a sub-grid model of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback by taking into account the state-of-the-art AGN physics, and used that model to study the effect of AGN feedback on the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy by performing two dimensional high-resolution (i.e., the Bondi radius is well resolved) simulations. In that work, typical values of model parameters were adopted. In the present work, we extend that study by exploring the effects of uncertainties of parameter values. Such a study is also useful for us to understand the respective roles of various components of the model. These parameters include the mass flux and velocity of AGN wind and radiative efficiency in both the hot and cold feedback modes, and the initial black hole (BH) mass. We find that the velocity of AGN wind in the hot mode is the most important quantity to control the typical accretion rate and luminosity of AGN, and the mass growth of the BH. The effect of the wind on star formation is less sensitive. Within the limited parameter range explored in the current work, a stronger AGN wind suppresses star formation within ~100 pc but enhances star formation beyond this radius, while the star formation integrated over the evolution time and the whole galaxy roughly remain unchanged. AGN radiation suppresses the BH accretion in a mild way, but dust is not considered here. Finally, a smaller initial BH mass results in a more violent evolution of the BH accretion rate. The corresponding AGN spends more time in the high-luminosity state and the percentage of BH mass growth is higher. Our results indicate the robustness of AGN feedback in keeping the galaxy quenched.

2. [A search for radio jets from massive young stellar objects. Association of radio jets with H2O and CH3OH masers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14729)

* U. Kavak et al.

Recent theoretical and observational studies debate the similarities between the formation process of high-mass (>8 Msun) and low-mass stars. The formation of low-mass star formation is directly associated with the presence of disks and jets. According to this scenario, radio jets are expected to be common in high-mass star-forming regions. We aim to increase the number of known radio jets in high-mass star forming regions by searching for radio jet candidates at radio continuum wavelengths. We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe 18 high-mass star-forming regions in the C band (6 cm, ~1.0 arcsec resolution) and K band (1.3 cm, ~0.3 arcsec resolution). We have searched for radio jet candidates by studying the association of radio continuum sources with shock activity signposts. We have identified 7 as the most probable radio jets. The radio luminosity of the radio jet candidates is correlated with the bolometric luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. About 7-36% of the radio jet candidates are associated with non-thermal emission. The radio jet candidates associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser emission are preferentially thermal winds and jets, while a considerable fraction of radio jet candidates associated with H2O masers show non-thermal emission, likely due to strong shocks. Our sample of 18 regions is divided in 8 less evolved, infrared-dark regions and 10 more evolved, infrared-bright regions. We have found that ~71% of the identified radio jet candidates are located in the more evolved regions. Similarly, 25% of the less evolved regions harbor one of the most probable radio jets, while up to 50% of the more evolved regions contain one of these radio jet candidates. This suggests that the detection of radio jets in high-mass star forming regions is larger in slightly more evolved regions.

3. [The Awakening Beast in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy KUG 1141+371 I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14254)

* Jiachen Jiang et al.

KUG 1141+371 is a Seyfert 1 galaxy that shows a simultaneous flux increase in the optical and UV bands in the past decade. For instance, the latest Swift observation in 2019 shows that the UVW2 flux of the AGN in KUG 1141+371 has increased by over one order of magnitude since 2009. Meanwhile, the soft X-ray flux of KUG 1141+371 also shows a steady increase by one order of magnitude since 2007. The significant multi-wavelength luminosity change is likely due to a boost of mass accretion rate from approximately 0.6% of the Eddington limit to 3.2%, assuming a black hole mass of 108M⊙. In this work, we conduct detailed multi-epoch X-ray spectral analysis focusing on the variability of the X-ray continuum emission and the puzzling soft excess emission. In addition, our SED models also suggest a simultaneous increase of disc temperature and a decreasing inner disc radius along with the increasing accretion rate. Finally, we discuss possible connection between KUG 1141+371 and black hole transients in outburst.

4. [On the TP-AGB contribution to the light of nearby disk galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13989)

* Eric E. Martínez-García et al

The study of the luminosity contribution from TP-AGB stars to the stellar populations of galaxies is crucial to determine their physical parameters (e.g., stellar mass and age). We use a sample of 84 nearby disk galaxies to explore diverse stellar population synthesis models with different luminosity contributions from TP-AGB stars. We fit the models to optical and NIR photometry, on a pixel by pixel basis. The statistics of the fits show a preference for a low luminosity contribution (i.e., high mass-to-light ratio in the NIR) from TP-AGB stars. Nevertheless, for 30-40 % of the pixels in our sample a high luminosity contribution (hence low mass-to-light ratio in the NIR) from TP-AGB stars is favored. According to our findings, the mean TP-AGB star luminosity contribution in nearby disk galaxies may vary with Hubble type. This may be a consequence of the variation of the TP-AGB mass-loss rate with metallicity, if metal-poor stars begin losing mass earlier than metal-rich stars, because of a pre-dust wind that precedes the dust-driven wind.

1. [Evolution of Galaxy Star Formation and Metallicity: Impact on Double Compact Objects Mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02800)

* Lumen Boco et al.

We study the impact of different galaxy statistics and empirical metallicity scaling relations on the merging rates and on the properties of compact objects binaries. First, we analyze the similarities and differences of using the star formation rate functions or the stellar mass functions as galaxy statistics for the computation of the cosmic star formation rate density. Then we investigate the effects of adopting the Fundamental Metallicity Relation or a classic Mass Metallicity Relation to assign metallicity to galaxies with given properties. We find that when the Fundamental Metallicity Relation is exploited, the bulk of the star formation occurs at relatively high metallicities even at high redshift; the opposite holds when the Mass Metallicity Relation is employed, since in this case the metallicity at which most of the star formation takes place strongly decreases with redshift. We discuss the various reasons and possible biases originating this discrepancy. Finally, we show the impact that these different astrophysical prescriptions have on the merging rates and on the properties of compact objects binaries; specifically, we present results for the redshift dependent merging rates and for the chirp mass and time delay distributions of the merging binaries.

1. [On the physics of UV absorption lines and their relations with Lyman continuum escape fractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03984)

* V. Mauerhofer et al.

The neutral intergalactic medium above redshift 6 is opaque to ionizing radiation, therefore one needs indirect measurements of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies of this epoch. Low-ionization state absorption lines are a common feature in the spectrum of galaxies, showing a diversity of strengths and shapes. Since these lines indicate the presence of neutral gas in front of the stars, they have been proposed to carry information on the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies. We study which processes are responsible for the shape of the absorption lines, to better understand their origin. We then explore whether the absorption lines can be used to predict the escape fractions. Using a radiation-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation and the radiative transfer code RASCAS, we generate mock CII 1334 and LyB lines of a virtual galaxy at redshift 3 as seen from many directions of observation. We also compute the escape fraction of ionizing photons in those directions and look for correlations between the lines and the escape fractions. We find that the resulting mock absorption lines are comparable to observations and that the lines and the escape fractions vary strongly depending on the direction of observation. Gas velocity and dust always affect the absorption profile significantly. We find no strong correlations between observable LyB or CII 1334 and the escape fraction. After correcting the continuum for attenuation by dust to recover the intrinsic continuum, the residual flux of CII 1334 correlates well with the escape fraction for directions with a dust corrected residual flux larger than 30%. For other directions, the relations have a strong dispersion, and the residual flux overestimates the escape fraction for most cases. Concerning LyB, the residual flux after dust correction does not correlate with the escape fraction but can be used as a lower limit. 

2. [The Origin of the Dust Extinction Curve in Milky Way-like Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03978)

* Qi Li et al.

We develop a cosmological model for the evolution of dust grains in galaxies with a distribution of sizes in order to understand the origin of the Milky Way dust extinction curve. Our model considers the formation of active dust in evolved stars, growth by accretion and coagulation, and destruction processes via shattering, sputtering, and astration in the ISM of galaxies over cosmic time. Our main results follow. Galaxies in our cosmological model with masses comparable to the Milky Way's at z~0 exhibit a diverse range of extinction laws, though with slopes and bump strengths comparable to the range observed in the Galaxy. The progenitors of the Milky Way have steeper slopes, and only flatten to slopes comparable to the Galaxy at z≈1. This owes to increased grain growth rates at late times/in high-metallicity environments driving up the ratio of large to small grains, with a secondary dependence on the graphite to silicate ratio evolution. The UV bump strengths depend primarily on the graphite to silicate ratio, and remain broadly constant in MW-like galaxies between z=3 and z=0, though show slight variability. Our models span comparable regions of bump-slope space as sightlines in the Galaxy do, though there is a lack of clear relationship between the model slopes and bump strengths owing to small scale fluctuations in the bump strength. Our models naturally produce slopes for some non-Milky Way analogs as steep as those of the LMC and SMC in metal poor galaxies, though notably the bump strengths are, on average, too large when comparing to the Magellanic clouds. This owes to the fact that we evolve the grain size distributions of graphites and silicates simultaneously, which is an oversimplification. Our model provides a novel framework to study the origins and variations of dust extinction curves in galaxies over cosmic time.


3. [Extended HNCO, SiO, and HC3N emission in 43 southern star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04354)

* Yu-Xin He et al.

We have selected 43 southern massive star-forming regions to study the spatial distribution of HNCO 404-303, SiO 2-1 and HC3N 10-9 line emission and to investigate their spatial association with the dust emission. The morphology of HNCO 404-303 and HC3N 10-9 agrees well with the dust emission. HC3N 10-9 tends to originate from more compact regions than HNCO 404-303 and SiO 2-1. We divided our sources into three groups: those in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), those associated with bubbles (Bubble), and the remaining sources, which are termed 'normal star forming regions' (NMSFR). These three groups, subdivided into three different categories with respect to line widths, integrated intensities, and column densities, hint at the presence of different physical and chemical processes. We find that the dust temperature Td, and the abundance ratios of NHNCO/NSiO and NHNCO/NHC3N show a decreasing trend towards the central dense regions of CMZ sources, while NHC3N/NSiO moves into the opposite direction. Moreover, a better agreement is found between Td and NHC3N/NSiO in Bubble and NMSFR category sources. Both outflow and inflow activities have been found in eight of the sixteen bubble and NMSFR sources. The low outflow detection rate indicates that in these sources the SiO 2-1 line wing emission is either below our sensitivity limit or that the bulk of the SiO emission may be produced by the expansion of an H{\sc\,ii} region or supernova remnant, which has pushed molecular gas away forming a shock and yielding SiO.

1. [MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) VII: A NOEMA pilot program to probe molecular gas in galaxies with measured circumgalactic gas flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04667)

* Jonathan Freundlich et al.

We present a pilot program using IRAM's NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to probe the molecular gas reservoirs of six z=0.6−1.1 star-forming galaxies whose circumgalactic medium has been observed in absorption along quasar lines-of-sight as part of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey and for which we have estimates of either the accretion or the outflow rate. This program is motivated by testing the quasi equilibrium model and the compaction scenario describing the evolution of galaxies along the main sequence of star formation, which imply tight relations between the gas content, the star formation activity, and the amount of gas flowing in and out. We report individual carbon monoxide CO(4-3), CO(3-2) and dust continuum upper limits, as well as stacked CO detections over the whole sample and the three galaxies identified with outflows. The resulting molecular gas fractions and depletion times are compatible with published scaling relations established within a mass-selected sample, indicating that galaxies selected through their absorption follow similar relations on average. We further detect the dust continuum of three of the quasars and a strong emission line in one of them, which we identify as CO(4-3). Extending the sample to more galaxies and deeper observations will enable to quantify how the molecular gas fraction and depletion time depend on the inflow and ouflow rates.

1. [Revisiting the Integrated Star Formation Law. II. Starbursts and the Combined Global Schmidt Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05363)

* Robert C. Kennicutt Jr. et al.

We compile observations of molecular gas contents and infrared-based star formation rates (SFRs) for 112 circumnuclear star forming regions, in order to re-investigate the form of the disk-averaged Schmidt surface density star formation law in starbursts. We then combine these results with total gas and SFR surface densities for 153 nearby non-starbursting disk galaxies from de los Reyes \& Kennicutt (2019), to investigate the properties of the combined star formation law, following Kennicutt (1998; K98). We confirm that the combined Schmidt law can be fitted with a single power law with slope n=1.5±0.05 (including fitting method uncertainties), somewhat steeper than the value n=1.4±0.15 found by K98. Fitting separate power laws to the non-starbursting and starburst galaxies, however, produces very different slopes (n=1.34±0.07 and 0.98±0.07, respectively), with a pronounced offset in the zeropoint (∼0.6\,dex) of the starburst relation to higher SFR surface densities. This offset is seen even when a common conversion factor between CO intensity and molecular hydrogen surface density is applied, and is confirmed when disk surface densities of interstellar dust are used as proxies for gas measurements. Tests for possible systematic biases in the starburst data fail to uncover any spurious sources for such a large offset. We tentatively conclude that the global Schmidt law in galaxies, at least as it is conventionally measured, is bimodal or possibly multi-modal. Possible causes may include changes in the small-scale structure of the molecular ISM or the stellar initial mass function. A single n∼1.5 power law still remains as a credible approximation or "recipe" for analytical or numerical models of galaxy formation and evolution.

2. [The evolution of the low-density HI intergalactic medium from z=3.6 to 0: Data, transmitted flux and HI column density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05861)

* Tae-Sun Kim et al.

We present a new, uniform analysis of the HI transmitted flux (F) and HI column density (N(HI)) distribution in the low-density IGM as a function of redshift z for 0<z<3.6 using 55 HST/COS FUV (Delta(z)=7.2 at z<0.5), five HST/STIS+COS NUV (Delta(z)=1.3 at z~1) and 24 VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES (Delta(z)=11.6 at 1.7<z<3.6) AGN spectra. We performed a consistent, uniform Voigt profile analysis to combine spectra taken with different instruments, to reduce systematics and to remove metal-line contamination. We confirm previously known conclusions on firmer quantitative grounds in particular by improving the measurements at z~1. Two flux statistics at 0<F<1, the mean HI flux and the flux probability distribution function (PDF), show that considerable evolution occurs from z=3.6 to z=1.5, after which it slows down to become effectively stable for z<0.5. However, there are large sightline variations. For the HI column density distribution function (CDDF, f proptional to N(HI)^(-beta)) at log (N(HI)/1cm^-2)=[13.5, 16.0], beta increases as z decreases from beta~1.60 at z~3.4 to beta~1.82 at z~0.1. The CDDF shape at lower redshifts can be reproduced by a small amount of clockwise rotation of a higher-z CDDF with a slightly larger CDDF normalisation. The absorption line number per z (dn/dz) shows a similar evolutionary break at z~1.5 as seen in the flux statistics. High-N(HI) absorbers evolve more rapidly than low-N(HI) absorbers to decrease in number or cross-section with time. The individual dn/dz shows a large scatter at a given z. The scatter increases toward lower z, possibly caused by a stronger clustering at lower z.

3. [Destruction of the central black hole gas reservoir through head-on galaxy collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05700)

* Yohei Miki et al.

Massive black holes in the central region of galaxies radiate a vast amount of light as active galactic nuclei by releasing gravitational energy of accreting gas when a sufficient amount of gas accretes onto the massive black holes. Galaxy collisions have been thought to enhance nucleus activity, by triggering mass fueling to the central massive black hole through angular momentum transfer. Here we show that galaxy collisions are also capable of suppressing black hole fueling by using an analytic model and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, applying the well-determined parameter sets for the galactic collision in the Andromeda galaxy. Our models demonstrate that a central collision of galaxies can strip the torus-shaped gas surrounding the massive black hole, the putative fueling source, away via momentum transfer between the torus gas and the infalling gas when the column-density of the infalling gas is higher than that of the torus. The derived condition for switching-off the black hole fueling indicates that a significant fraction of currently bright nuclei can become inactive, reminiscent of fading/dying active nucleus phenomena associated with galaxy merging events. Galaxy collisions may therefore be responsible both for switching-off and turning-on the nucleus activity, depending on the collision orbit (head-on or far-off-centre).


4. [What Determines Unique Spectra of Super-Eddington Accretors?: Origin of Optically Thick and Low Temperature Coronae in Super-Eddington Accretion Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05386)

* Norita Kawanaka et al. 

Existence of relatively cool (kBT≲10 keV) and optically thick (τ≳3) coronae are inferred above super-Eddington accretion flow such as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), GRS 1915+105, and narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1), which contrasts the cases in sub-Eddington accretion flows, which are associated with coronae with kBT∼100 keV and τ∼1. To understand their physical origin, we investigate the emission properties of the corona which is formed by the gas blown off the super-Eddington inner disk by radiation pressure. We assume that the corona is heated by the reconnection of magnetic loops emerged from the underlying disk. We show that this radiation pressure driven wind can act as an optically thick corona which upscatters thermal soft photons from the underlying disk, and that with a reasonable parameter set we can theoretically reproduce the coronal optical depth and temperature which are inferred by spectral fittings of observational data. By contrast, the coronal optical depth cannot be so high in sub-Eddington cases, since the coronal material is supplied from the disk via evaporation and there is a maximum limit on the evaporation rate. We support that the low temperature, optically thick Comptonization should be a key signature of super-Eddington accretion flow.
